# Project Rogueborne
A roguelike inspired by the soulsborne series.

## Planned Features
- Permadeath and Procedurally generated dungeons &mdash; Wouldn't be a roguelike without it.
- Bonfires &mdash; Places to rest and regain health at the cost of respawning all the enemies in the current level.
- Soul-based experience system &mdash; Every enemy drops some souls, which can be used for character progression. Players don't level up and then choose a stat to upgrade, instead they can upgrade whatever stats they want if they have the experience for it.
- Money as a resource separate from Souls &mdash; instead of going all the way into Soulsborne territory, money will instead be its own resource.
- [Siren RPG](https://github.com/ElectricCoffee/SirenRPG)-based stats system &mdash; Player stats are based on the seven attributes of _Strength_, _Agility_, _Dexterity_, _Constitution_, _Wisdom_, _Intelligence_, and _Charisma_. Every ability is derived from a combination thereof.
- Siren RPG-based RNG system &mdash; Encounters, skill checks, damage calculations, etc. are all based on virtual dice-rolls.
